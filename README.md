# week-5-challenge

In this challenge, I added some code into a JS file where I was able to create a function that will populate a table
and assign each row to a specific hour in the work day. I made the hours added into military time to make it easier for me to code.

I also utilized the moment.js to help me determine which hours were past, present, or future. So I could track which tasks I still had time to do, which ones I missed, and which ones I had coming up. Past hours would be grey, current red, future green.

Utilizing JSON, I was able to store the tasks whent eh save button was clicked. That way, when I left the page and came back I would still see those tasks that I had saved.
